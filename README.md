📈 Sales Forecasting Using Time Series & Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future sales using historical time-series data. The aim is to understand temporal patterns such as trend and seasonality, establish a baseline model, and improve predictions using advanced machine learning techniques.


Objective
Forecast future sales from historical data
Capture trend and seasonality through feature engineering
Use Linear Regression as a baseline model
Compare baseline performance with advanced ML models

Methodology
Performed time-series analysis without shuffling data
Engineered lag features, rolling averages, and calendar features
Built a baseline Linear Regression model
Trained and tuned advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM)
Evaluated models using MAE and RMSE

Results & Insights
Linear Regression provided a strong baseline reference
Boosting models achieved better accuracy than the baseline
Future predictions highlight overall trend direction rather than exact values

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
